# Virtual Tourist App
This project was developed as part of the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree program. The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate proficiency in iOS development using UIKit.

## Features
- Users can drop pins on any location on the map, representing a virtual stop on a tour.
- The app connects to the Flickr API to fetch images related to the pinned location.
- Persistent Storage: Images and their associations with pins are saved locally, allowing users to revisit their saved locations and images.

## Tools
- UIKit: Primary framework for building the appâ€™s user interface.
- MapKit: For displaying and interacting with the map.
- Core Data: Used for persisting images and pin associations.
- Flickr API: Source of images based on user-selected locations.
- Swift: Programming language used for developing the app.
